# Queuing System Redesign

Below is a description of a webpage that needs to be redesigned for better user experience. Your job will be to redesign
both the Manage Queues and Add / Edit Queues pages.

## Deliverables
Create a webpage(s) that is representative of the original version, but includes the following improvements:

- Improve the look and feel so that it both looks more attractive, but is also easier to use.

- Include accessibility features such as labeling form controls, alternative text for images, and ensuring that all
interactive parts of the page are keyboard accessible.

-  The content should be responsive to the size of the page in such a way that it both looks good and is still easy to
use on a variety of screen sizes.

The deliverables should be viewable from a web browser such as Chrome or Edge. It only needs to contain enough
functionality to demonstrate the design of the user interface. It does not need to implement any sort of backend work,
such as editing and persisting information. Any data that needs to appear on the page(s) can be statically defined. If
multiple web pages are required links between the pages should work.

## Limitations
The deliverable must be in HTML, and can use Javacript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and CSS. No other libraries or frameworks
can be used.
